//! Self-similar voxel fractals adapted for a base-2 recursive octree.
//!
//! Each fractal here is expressed as "which of the 8 sub-cells of a
//! 2×2×2 node are filled at every level of recursion, and with what
//! block". Since the tree is content-addressed (see `super::tree`),
//! every level dedups to a single library node — a depth-`d` fractal
//! is O(d) storage, no matter how wide its silhouette becomes.
//!
//! # Coloring — bringing PySpace's orbit traps into a voxel world
//!
//! The PySpace reference (`external/PySpace`) colors fractals with
//! *orbit traps*: a running min/max/sum of the folded point's position
//! tracked through the iteration, then mapped to RGB at the hit. The
//! visual effect is that different *structural roles* (corners, edges,
//! face centers) get different hues — the geometry's self-similarity
//! shows through the color.
//!
//! We can't fold at render time, but we can bake the equivalent into
//! the voxel palette: assign **different blocks to different slot
//! roles**. A Menger corner cell gets one color, an edge cell gets
//! another. Each level of self-similarity inherits the same role
//! mapping, so the colored structure repeats at every zoom.
//!
//! Per-fractal palette choices are made by the `bootstrap_*_world`
//! functions and match the aesthetic of PySpace's original scenes
//! (cream Sierpinski, cool-blue Menger, prismatic dust, ...).
//!
//! # Binary adaptation of PySpace's fractal zoo
//!
//! PySpace targets a ray-marched SDF renderer with `FoldScale(2)`
//! (binary self-similarity). Our tree subdivides at scale 2 — some
//! fractals are natural fits, others need recasting into "pick a
//! subset of 8 cells per level":
//!
//! | PySpace fractal          | Binary adaptation                     |
//! |--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
//! | `menger` / `mausoleum`   | [`menger`] — 7/8 cells (hollow cube) |
//! | `sierpinski_tetrahedron` | [`sierpinski_tet`] — 4 cube corners   |
//! | —                        | [`cantor_dust`] — 4 tetrahedral corners|
//! | (inverse of Menger)      | [`jerusalem_cross`] — 3 L-shape cells |
//! | Sierpinski pyramid       | [`sierpinski_pyramid`] — 5 cells      |
//!
//! SDF-only PySpace scenes (mandelbox, tree_planet, snow_stadium,
//! butterweed_hills) are not ported — they depend on a continuous
//! distance estimator and have no faithful discrete-subdivision
//! representation.
